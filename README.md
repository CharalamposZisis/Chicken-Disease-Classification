# Chicken-Disease-Classification 🐔🦠

📢  👉  Project Overview 

  In this project, I worked on classifying chicken diseases based on fecal images. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in creating a CI/CD pipeline, Git Hub Actions and deploying it on AWS. The project was developed following the instructions of Krish Naik (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1bfK8ZJgkE&t=12327s). 

  
💡 Technologies & Techniques Used:

🔸Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification. <br />
🔸Automation and DevOps:: CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.<br />
🔸Cloud Deployment: AWS for hosting and running the application<br />


💯 Next Steps:

In my future projects, I plan to implement these kinds of automations independently.

  
## 🛠 The Workflow of the project:

1. Update config.yaml
2. Update secrets.yaml
3. Update params.yaml
4. Update the entity
5. Update the configuration manager in src config (src/cvvClassifier/config)
6. Update the components
7. Update the pipeline 
8. Update the main.py
9. Update the dvc.yaml
